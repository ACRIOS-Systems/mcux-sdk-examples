# mcux-sdk-examples

This repository is for MCUXpresso SDK examples delivery and it contains the NXP officially delivered examples in MCUXpresso SDK. 

**The examples delivery in the project cannot be built and run solely**, it's a part of MCUXpresso SDK overall delivery which is composed of several project deliveries. Please go to the [main repository](https://github.com/NXPmicro/mcux-sdk/) to get the MCUXpresso overall delivery to be able to build and run examples in this repository.
